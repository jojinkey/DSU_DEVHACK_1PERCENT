> Introducing GreenWave - GreenWaven is your plant's BFF! Picture this – AI playing plant detective, crafting custom plant/crop care plans, and a futuristic Plant Care Kit that sprinkles tech magic with remote wifi watering; built using MVVM architecture with local caching using Room SQLite Database.




- 2024: A gauge for soil Detection.
- 2024: Plantation Guidance.


- Get `weatherKey` from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)
,  `trefleKey` from [Trefle](https://trefle.io/) and `plantnetKey` from [Plantnet](https://my.plantnet.org/)


All the operational capabilities are integrated within the domain directory, facilitating access to both remote and local data from the designated data folder. The information is then conveyed to the viewmodel through the utilization of the Use Case in adherence to Clean Architecture principles.

Incorporation of an open-source API.
Implementation of Android Data Binding.
Adoption of MVVM Architecture coupled with Clean Architecture.
Utilization of Android Room SQLite Database for local caching.
Integration of theming in M3 for both Light and Dark modes.
